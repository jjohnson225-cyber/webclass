<h1>Ten Principles for Good Design</h1>
<h2>By Dieter Rams</h2>

<h3>1. Good design is innovative</h3>
<p> The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities<br>
    for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</p>

<h3> 2. Good design makes a product useful</h3>
<p> A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good<br>
    design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it. </p>

<h3> 3. Good design is aesthetic</h3>
<p> The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect out person and our well-<br>
    being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</p>

<h3> 4. Good design makes a product understandable</h3>
<p> It clasrifies the products structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.</p>

<h3> 5. Good design is unobtrusive</h3>
<p> Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore<br>
    be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression. </p>

<h3> 6. Good design is honest</h3>
<p> It does not make a product more innovative, powerful, ot valueable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer<br>
    with promises that cannot be kept.</p>

<h3> 7. Good design is long-lasting</h3>
<p> It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years - even<br>
    in today's throwaway society.</p>

<h3> 8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail</h3>
<p> Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the user.</p>

<h3> 9. Good design is environmentally friendly</h3>
<p>Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves anf minimizes physical and<br> 
    visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</p>

<h3> 10. Good design is as little design as possible</h3>
<p> Less, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials</p>
